== Frequently Asked Questions ==
*What is a domain keyword?*
This is a piece of text that we will look for in the referring domain (host). For example, if you entered "4web" as the domain keyword, any sites linking to your site with the text "4web" in their domain will be blocked. The following example sites would be blocked in this example:

* 4webmasters.org
* 4websitecreators.com
* made4web.com

*Why can't I add a specific domain keyword?*
You may only enter a domain keyword once, so if it exists in the list you can't add it a second time. Also, you cannot add a domain keyword that would block your own site. For example, if our site is "wpmaintainer.com" and we enter the domain keyword "wp" â€“ the plugin will block any links from our site that point to other pages on the site.
